## <a name="overview"></a> Overview 

Billing your customers has never been easier before. This document explains how to make a technical integration to the MobilePay Subscription API. The audience for this document is either technical integrators acting on behalf of merchants or merchants themselves. You can find more information on our <a href="https://developer.mobilepay.dk/subscriptions-main">Developer Portal</a>.

Our MobilePay Subscriptions REST api enables you to:

1. Establish and manage **Agreements** between you, the **Merchant**, and MobilePay **Users**.
2. Create **Subscription Payments** in relation to an established **Agreement** and get notified about the status via REST callbacks. **Subscription Payments** are requested 1 day before the actual booking date - no manual user confirmation required!

- Read the FAQ's for Subscriptions <a href="https://developer.mobilepay.dk/faq/subscriptions">here</a>
- Billing your customers with MobilePay Subscriptions is easy using our [API](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/subscriptions-main).


### <a name="overview_onboarding"></a>Merchant onboarding

You enroll to the Subscriptions Production via <a href="https://mobilepay.dk/da-dk/Pages/mobilepay.aspx">www.MobilePay.dk</a> or the MobilePay  Administration portal. Then you get access to the MobilePay Sandbox environment, where you can test the API. The Sandbox environment is located on <a href="https://sandbox-developer.mobilepay.dk/">The Sandbox Developer Portal </a> 
You can use the Subscriptions API in test mode, which does not affect your live data or interact with the banking networks.

When the merchant is onboarded, he has a user in MobilePay that is able to manage which products the merchant wishes to use.

**The flow:**

In short - The flow is described in the following 4 steps:

[Step 1: Call /connect/authorize to initiate user login and consent](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/developersupport/openid/authorize/) 

Step 2: Wait for the response by listening on the redirect URI and get the authorization code 

Step 3: Exchange the authorization code for tokens using /connect/token

Step 4: Keep the session alive by using the refresh token

Step 5: Follow Best Practice 

The merchant must grant consent to an application(__Client__). The client is the application that is attempting to get access to the user's account.  The client needs to get consent from the user before it can do so. This consent is granted through mechanism in the [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) protocol suite. <br />
Integrators and merchants are the same as __Clients__ in the OAuth 2.0 protocol. The __Client__ must initiate the [hybrid flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth) specified in OpenID connect. For __Subscriptions__ product the __Client__ must request consent from the merchant using the `subscriptions` scope. You also need to specify `offline_access` scope, in order to get the refresh token. The authorization server in sandbox is located [here](https://api.sandbox.mobilepay.dk/merchant-authentication-openidconnect).<br />
If the merchant grants consent, an authorization code is returned which the __Client__ must exchange for an id token, an access token and a refresh token. The refresh token is used to refresh ended sessions without asking for merchant consent again. This means that if the __Client__ receives an answer from the api gateway saying that the access token is invalid, the refresh token is exchanged for a new access token and refresh token. <br /> <br />
An example of how to use OpenID connect in C# can be found [here](https://github.com/MobilePayDev/MobilePay-Invoice/tree/master/ClientExamples).

When user clicks on this button, merchant must do back-end call to   
[`"/authorize"`](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/developersupport/openid/authorize/) endpoint for initiating  authentication flow. You need to wait for the response by listening on the redirect URI and get the Authorization Code. Our system will re-direct the merchant back to your system also using the redirect URL.

### <a name="openid-connect-libraries"></a>Implementing OpenID Connect protocol
There are many OpenID Connect certified libraries for different platforms, so you just have to chose the one, that suits you best [from this list](http://openid.net/developers/certified/#RPLibs).

In order to authenticate to the API, all requests to the API must contain at least three authentication headers:
1. `x-ibm-client-id`
2. `x-ibm-client-secret`  
3. `Authorization` 

```console
$ curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" --header 'x-ibm-client-id: client-id' --header 'x-ibm-client-secret: client-secret' --url https://<mobile-pay-root>/api/merchants/me/resource
```
