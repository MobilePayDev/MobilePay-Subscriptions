<b>How subscription flow works from app webview</b> 

If you use webviews in your app, user will experience dual device flow:
<ol>
<li>MobilePay landing page is opened in your app webview.</li>
<li>User needs to enter/review phone number and press continue.</li>
<li>User gets a push message or need to open MobilePay app manually.</li>
</ol>
If you load landing page in native phone browser, flow stays the same (single device flow), where MobilePay app is launched automatically.
